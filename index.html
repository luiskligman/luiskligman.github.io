        <p>
          In our affinity diagram, we first have our potential problems that the creators or users may run into while using it. 
          Then we have the essentials which is what the App must have. Then we have a category called application which is what our app
          is designed to do. After this, we have a category about potential marketing and how we will get people to start 
          using our app. Lastly, we have a category called benefits, which is to show how this app can help the user.
