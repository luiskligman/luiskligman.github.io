        <p>
          In our affinity diagram, we first have our potential problems that the creators or users may run into while using it. 
          Then we have the essentials which is what the App must have. Then we have a category called application which is what our app
          is designed to do. After this, we have a category about potential marketing and how we will get people to start 
          using our app. Lastly, we have a category called benefits, which is to show how this app can help the user.

        <p>
          In my storyboard it depicts the challenges faced by a college student who is living off campus and is trying to park on campus for class.
          It shows how at first he could not find parking and was late to class, but by using our app he was able to arrive directly to an open parking
          spot and get to class early and on time. Leading him to get good grades and graduate.

           Our sketches show the process a typical user would go through when using the passport parking app. The sketches

           Our prototype shows the start-to-end process of using our app and vividly shows how quick and simple it can be to locate and reserve a parking
           spot through our app.
